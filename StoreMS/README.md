### What is a Microservice Architecture?

Microservices are both an architectural style and a way of programming software. With microservices, applications are broken down into their smallest, independent elements. Unlike the traditional, monolithic approach to applications, where everything is built into one piece, microservices are separate elements that work together to perform the same tasks.

Each one of those elements or processes is a microservice. This approach to software development values granularity, simplicity, and the ability to share a similar process across multiple applications. It is a critical element of optimizing application development toward a cloud-native model.

However, the biggest question is, what are the benefits of using a microservices infrastructure? Simply put, the goal is to deliver quality software faster. While this can be achieved with microservices, other issues must be considered. For example, splitting applications into microservices is not enough; they need to be managed and coordinated, and the data they create and modify.

### What is a monolithic Architecture?

Monolithic architectures are designed to make it possible for different companies to carry out their daily business activities with all the necessary components in a single application and in a logical way in each case. Two examples of prevalent monolithic architectures are ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) and CRM (Customer Relation Management).

To solve this type of problem, SOA (Service Oriented Architecture) was created, a type of architecture in which the application can be decoupled into small modules known as services. All these services are integrated using an aggregation layer called a bus. All services communicate through this service bus. Over time, this application can become monolithic over time since all services are integrated with the same layer.
